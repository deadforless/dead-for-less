        <h2>Wretched</h2>
        <p>
She can only ever find her true self when she’s swallowed whole

Oh my god what have I done?
You said I’d be the only one
My god where has she gone?
Oh, wretched, wretched

If she could only

Put the mask back over your eyes 
Feeling, touching, guessing
Practice your lies
Easy going happy
Stand in your line
Waiting, patient, patient
Breaking your spine
Bearing all you long for

It’s only ever when the towel’s thrown in 
She swallows something to tame the soul
Wrapped inside the darkness 
Falling deeper into the hole

Oh my god, what’s going on?
Was I not the only one?
My god she’s up and gone
Oh, wretched, wretched

Don’t waste your time
Guilty, worried, sorry 
No time to cry 
Let’s get, fucking
Out of your mind
Stir the power in you
You’ll learn to find
Exactly what it tells you

She can only ever find her true self
when the ocean swallows her whole
Void of stimulation
she can finally lose control 

Never never never never never never never never
Never ending, always something

Oh my god what have I done?
I thought I was the only one
My god she’s on the runOh, wretched, wretched, wretched
        </p>

        <h2>Light of Day</h2>
        <p>
            How can it be 
            Dreams that mesmerized my young mind 
            Falling to pieces at the hands of the savior I’ve come to despise 
            
            It’s not what I wanted 
            What I had in mind 
            Now I’ve discovered 
            Your words do not light the way
             
            Fuck your desires 
            Fuck all your lies 
            I’ve flown from the murder 
            And now I see the Light of Day 
            
            How can it be 
            My crown has fallen now can’t you see
            But now I’ve decided that I am no longer your toy misery 
            
            Fuck your desires 
            Fuck all your lies 
            I’ve flown from the murder 
            And now I see the Light of Day 
            
            I’m no longer victim to your 
            Twisted game of mind and matter 
            You don’t own me own me anymore 
            
            Oh the joy it brings
            To watch you crumble to the ground
            Tiny man, you poor, sick, thing
            I’ll define my path from now on 
            Oh tiny man, you’ll never own me again 
            
            I’m no longer weak you bastard 
            I’m no longer bruised and broken
            I’m no longer your toy plaything 
            I’m not longer what you want 
            
            I will feed all the tiny minds you lead 
            You will never fool another again 
            
            You will see just how vicious lambs can be 
            You can’t stop me now that I’ve found the Light of Day 
        </p>

        <h2>The Plunge</h2>
        <p>
            
Wait
Wait for 
Wait for me, I’m getting
I’m getting closer 
Please don’t 
Let me fall

Ahh

Stones fall from my grasp 
Walls are ripping, tumbling as I fly 
Screams, out my teeth 
Like I’m howling to the night 
You, you couldn’t wait 
Now I’ve met all of your lies

Ooh
Ahh 
What’s it gonna be now 
Please 
Where ya goin?
If I fall I’ll drown

Ahh

When the water breaks 
My bones splinter blood pours out my eyes
Cold envelopes me 
Muscles seizing shaking how I tried 
I took the plunge 
In the absence of your hand 

Wait

Why don’t you jump in 
The water’s fine
What’s the matter are you surprised
That’s right baby 
I haven’t died 

        </p>

        <h2>Rare Bird, Bronze</h2>
        <p>
            
Born into these hopeless waters 
Here you’re merely prey 
searching through the cluttered drawers 
For some reason to stay 
The outside’s pink
But the inside’s grey 
There’s so much to think
But there’s less to say 
I can’t believe it took me goddamn years to find out I’ve turned to clay 
Twisting my limbs my lips my neck in every goddamn way 
The mud inside spilled out your mouth slowly the air got cold
As I melted to your mold I slowly became stone 

Was there anything to wish for 
In that dark dank tomb 
Place me up upon your mantle 
Help me bind [barricade] my womb
Every time it felt unstable 
I sprouted my hind legs 
We would never be unfaithful 
Praised everything he said

The outside’s pink
But the inside’s grey
There’s a lot to think 
But less to say 
A rare bird
Trapped in its cage 
But you can’t teach 
The feral to behave 
Lost the smile 
Given up the game 
All my love 
Replaced with pain 
Years of hoping no one at the table 
Peers into my bowl 
Asks me what it is I’m eating 
Or how I find the hole

        </p>

        <h2>Sorry for Breaking You</h2>
        <p>

            Ok, alright, I get it now
            I'm yours, but you're not mine
            My body is your temple
            Apparently, so is my mind
            
            Stuff your words into my head
            Point out my hollow chest
            How weak I have become
            Inside your nest
            
            Can you help me
            Strong, strong man?
            I can't do this
            Without your hand
            
            Oh, I'm sick and tired of the bullshit
            You think I'm fucking high?
            I'm the scariest of bitches
            What because I speak my mind?
            
            Thanks for sharing
            Your opinions baby
            I'll take that to heart
            Because I yearn to please
            What's taller
            
            I'm so weak and
            I don't try
            I stand bleeding
            You sit blind
            
            You roll it out just like a buffet
            Tell me, take what I please
            Then you pull the passion from my rib cage
            Drain my every sympathy
            
            When did I become your version
            Didn't realize that's my name
            I followed your directions up to this point baby
            Seemed to think you had me fully trained
            
            Broke, worthless, stupid girl
            Crack me open, take my pearl
            Twisted lures and secret schemes
            Empty words and one fact team
            I can't take it, let me out
            Beat my face and tie my mouth
            
            Once you face what I've become
            Won't you see the wrong you've done?
            
            Fuck you, you fucking mouse
            Fuck you, you fucking liar
            Fuck you, you fucking bull
            Fuck you, you fucking spider
            Fuck you and your probing eyes
            
            Fuck, do you fucking mind?
            
            Ohh
            
            I'm fucking tired
            
            Dare you to try and tie my hands again
            Dare you to try and point the blame
            I'll show you what it is that you've created
            And you can tell me to my face
            
            Just try hard
            That's what you said
            Try harder
            Am I dead?
            I've died
            And now I'm recreated
            In the size
            Originated for my head
            Now you feel all the dread
            That's boiled up 
            inside my hollow chest
            
        </p>

        <h2>Tantalus</h2>
        <p>
            Fallen failure
            Sheds his ire
            
            Are you out there, 
            my sweet daughter?
            
            Even if I'm small
            Even if I'm worthless
            I will break your fall
            I can be your defense
            
            Help me, I failed
            Please just, believe me
            
            Is it me or is it my desires,
            Always lighting fires this way?
            
            I can see my figure as a father
            Standing in the water again
            
            As I reach I can't seem to find you
            No matter how hard I try
            
            Every day that passes by without you
            A small part of me dies
            
            Despite all of my tries
            A small part of me dies
            
            Daughter, I failed you
            My wound bleeds forever
        </p>

        <h2>Last</h2>
        <p>
            
Ooo

Ah

Ah

Is this what it's like
Knowing how to leave
But choosing to stay
Joined in your breathing?

I love you
So it seems
Hard knowing
What that means

Then I
See your eyes
And I
Die inside

Let me stay forever
Preserved in stone
Memorize each detail
We'll never grow old

I can't say how much it means
Please don't slip away from me

Stay here in the moment
What looms is growing
Right now, right here
Is everything worth knowing?

Eyes 
Wide
Climb my
Mind

Please just give me one more minute
Please just give me one more minute
Please just give me one more minute
Please just give me one more minute
Please just give me one more minute

Please just give me one last moment
